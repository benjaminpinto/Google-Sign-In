# Google Sign In Page Tests

![Cypress Tests](https://github.com/benjaminpinto/Google-Sign-In/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This project is a result of a code challenge that demands write test cases for [Google's Sign In page](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).

To write these tests, I've used a few plugins to extend Cypress capabilities and to check the code syntax:

- [cypress-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro/);
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) and [eslint-plugin-cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-cypress);

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I've used versions `v16.15.0` and `8.5.5` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I recommend you to use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

> **Note:** This project doesn't handle sensible data to perform tests (tokens/passwords/etc), so I didn't used a `cypress.env.json` file.

> **Important:** This project uses Github actions to implement CI. If you want to clone it and run at your own repository, remember to update project's ID at [`cypress.config.js`](./cypress.config.js) file, and set your CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY at Github secrets.

## About the project structure

- Spec files are localized at [`cypress/e2e`](/cypress/e2e/) folder;
- Custom commands are organized at [`support`](cypress/support) folder;
- Github Actions is properly configured and the project tests results are connected with Cypress Dashboard. I've configured parallelization with 4 threads at Github Actions, but considering that I've reached my monthly free tier limit, just one thread is in fact executing all spec files.
